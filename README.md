# Hello my name is Diego Rivera 

## Who I am?
I am a full stack developer, oriented to Front-end design.
Since I can remember I have been captivated with the world of Technology, I have had many jobs in the Electrical, Mechanical area and it was not until 2017 that I had my first real approach to programming by learning C for microcontrollers.

## What I do?
Currently I dedicate myself to working on personal projects that allow me to improve my technical skills and learn new topics.

## Where am i going
My main objective both in life and in the path of programming is to be able to generate positive changes in the world, the world is a huge place where programming can generate even more enormous changes, as a great wise man said: "If you can imagine it, you can program it".


## What technologies do i use
